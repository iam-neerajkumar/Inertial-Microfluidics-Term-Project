# Inertial Microfluidics Term Paper

## Abstract  
Inertial microfluidics studies how inertial and viscous forces manipulate fluids and particles at the microscale. This report covers particle dynamics, Dean flows in curved channels, and effects of channel geometry on flow and mixing. It highlights applications in biomedicine.

**Keywords:** Inertial microfluidics, Particle migration, Dean flow, Biomedical applications.
